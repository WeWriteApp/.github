# WeWrite 

WeWrite is a social collaborative notes app where every page is a fundraiser. Your ideas can start in your private drafts or in the safety of small private groups, and they can grow and mature as they're edited by trusted contributors. Once the idea is ready, you can bring your polished idea to the public and start collecting funds from readers!
